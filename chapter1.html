            <p class="quote">2 Corinthians 5:17-21 NKJV</p>
            <p>17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 18 Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, 19 that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation. 20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. 21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>Once we surrender our lives to Jesus Christ, our LIFE has been changed for the better. Our old rotten lives have not been refurbished, reconditioned, nor retouched, but have become brand new in Jesus.</p>
            <p>Christ Jesus came to reconcile men to God. (2 Corinthians 5:19) Jesus didn't come to condemn us but to save us. He didn't set up a tally board to count our sins but to erase them, which makes us brand new! A fresh start!</p>
            <p>A changed LIFE has turned me into an ambassador. Ambassador simply means representative. You are now a representation of the goodness of God. An example of His grace and mercy, so to speak.</p>

            <p>Let us value the fresh start we have received from Christ Jesus. This is a miracle that started in you.</p>
            <p>Sharing this miracle of transformation is the beginning of being His ambassador. It is not that hard, is it?</p>

    <!-- Lesson 2: Receiving God's Forgiveness -->
    <section id="lesson2">
        <h2>Lesson 2: Receiving God’s Forgiveness</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>CONNECT</h3>
            <p>How easy or hard is it for you to say sorry?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>WORDS TO PONDER</h3>
            <p class="quote">1 John 1:9 NKJV</p>
            <p>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>Do you have a loan that you are having a hard time paying? Do you have obligations you cannot fulfill that will eventually put you in prison? What would you feel if you said “sorry” and there was no response? If one day, the person you owe suddenly told you that all your debts were canceled, what would you feel? This was exactly what Jesus did for you.</p>
            <p>We need to confess our wrongdoings to Jesus. Human nature has a very strong tendency to commit wrongdoings against God—in short, sin, which is any action that doesn’t please God. When this occurs, the Bible teaches us what to do: repent, confess, and apologize.</p>
            <p>Jesus is faithful and just to forgive us our sins. This means Jesus has the authority to pronounce forgiveness upon us. Even in our unfaithfulness, He remains faithful.</p>
            <p>Receiving forgiveness means we are cleansed. Sin is like a deadly spiritual virus that needs to be eliminated. It spreads quickly and damages both our physical and spiritual being. Confessing our sins to Jesus cleanses us from all these and restores our well-being.</p>
            <p>Unrighteousness? What is it? It means morally wrong, wickedness, or simply anything that is evil. To be cleansed from all unrighteousness in the name of Jesus is something that we should cherish.</p>

            <h3>DIG DEEP</h3>
            <p>What is the most horrible sin that you have done in your life? Do you believe that Jesus possesses the authority to forgive this?</p>
            <p>Are you having a hard time saying sorry? Why?</p>
            <p>Did you know that Jesus is eagerly waiting to hear the “magic word”—sorry—from you?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <p>Do you want to move on in your life? Asking forgiveness from Jesus is a pivotal point to make this happen.</p>
            <p>Do you want to do this today?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Dear Jesus, I believe You are the Son of God, my Savior. I confess to You all my sins. For all the sins that I have committed against God and men, forgive me! Wash me and cleanse me from all my sins in the name of Jesus Christ. Lead me in the path of righteousness and help me to sin no more. In Jesus’ name, I pray, Amen.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>CONNECT</h3>
            <p>Have you ever felt like an outcast in a group, in your circle of friends, or in your family?</p>
            <p>Have you experienced being the teacher’s pet? The favorite?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>WORDS TO PONDER</h3>
            <p class="quote">Ephesians 2:8-9 NKJV</p>
            <p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>Getting approval from our superiors, boss, or parents can really boost our self-confidence. Approval means we did something “good,” and the more we continue in this positive pattern, we will most likely become the “apple of their eyes.” In short, we end up as their favorite.</p>
            <p>What is grace? The Bible says that we are saved by grace, which means the unmerited favor from God. Our old sinful ways will not merit approval from God. In fact, our sin merits us a penalty. But God saved us not because we deserved to be saved, but because of His favor—nothing more and nothing less.</p>
            <p>Faith didn’t originate from us. We didn’t produce it. Faith is a gift from God that we need to activate. Faith is simply trusting Jesus in every aspect of our life. Faith is clinging to Him no matter what situation we are in, whether good or bad.</p>
            <p>Good works will not merit us salvation. If good works could buy us heaven, then the wealthy would have an advantage. If good works could bring us to heaven, then it would nullify the death of Jesus on the cross. If doing good works were the stairway to heaven, then we could boast about ourselves before God and downplay what He did for us.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>DIG DEEP</h3>
            <p>How will you show God your appreciation for the unmerited favor you received through Jesus Christ?</p>
            <p>Are you more of a doubter or a person who can easily trust someone? Jesus, the Son of God, is asking for your full trust in Him. Can you give it?</p>
            <p>When the Bible says that we have nothing to boast before Him—not even our good works—are you comfortable with it?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <p>Giving donations to the poor, praying three times a day, fasting, and going to church every Sunday are good practices, but they will not earn us heaven. We do all of these to appreciate God’s grace—not to buy salvation. Unmerited favor has been bestowed upon the believers of Jesus Christ. Do you intend to share this favor with your family?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Thank God for the favor we received, which we don’t deserve. May the grace of God, given to us freely, make us appreciate what Jesus did on the cross. Pray for an opportunity to share this wonderful saving grace. In Jesus’ name, I pray, Amen.</p>

            <h3>WORDS TO PONDER</h3>
            <p class="quote">Matthew 11:28-30 NKJV</p>
            <p>28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>In this verse, Jesus Christ is handing out an invitation for us to experience a great "vacation", a great rest that will never be equaled. Do you want to receive it at no cost whatsoever on your part? Do you want to accept this invitation?</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ understands that we are so tired and weary in our life. Some sources of stress:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Money problem</li>
                <li>Marital problem</li>
                <li>Medical problem</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The invitation actually means that Jesus is willing and able to help us with the issues in life that wear us down.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Many people don't care about what we are going through in life.</li>
                <li>Some people understand our situation and are very much willing to help, but do not have the ability to do so.</li>
                <li>Some people have the ability to help us, but are not willing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With all these, may we appreciate Jesus words, "Come to me". Unlike some people, Jesus understands, Jesus is willing, and Jesus is able. Jesus is offering a job that will bring satisfaction to our souls.</p>

            <p>The photo here illustrates how a stronger cow guides the novice cow through a yoke attached to its back. In other words, Jesus will help us carry our problems. Jesus will surely guide us. Jesus will make us productive in life while resting in His presence.</p>
            <p>What heavy yoke are you carrying today?</p>
            <p>Do you want to lift it up to Jesus? Do you believe that He can help you out?</p>
            <p>Have you ever wondered why Jesus never promised that you will never encounter problems in life again? Do you see any bright side to what you are going through today?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>

As I walk through this dark alley of mine, please give me the strength to be victorious, guide me, and let me take note of all these things I'm going through.

            <p>Initiative. Most people don't get what they want in life because of lack of initiative. In this verse, Jesus Christ is cheering us to take the initiative. We are encouraged by God to do the asking.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Isn't it great to know that the Maker of the Universe still finds time to attend to our personal needs?</li>

                <li>Our God is just a prayer away. No telephone charges, lines will never be busy and will never be offline.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you desire to level up your asking into seeking, this is encouraged too.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Isn't it comforting to know that once we seek, there is a promise of finding what we are searching for?</li>

            <p>Some of us may not be in the mood of asking nor seeking but we want to do the knocking. We are in a rush! Desperate maybe. A case of emergency!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jesus Christ Will not consider us a nuisance when we do the knocking.</li>
                <li>"Door will be opened" means that this act is very much welcome and we are not prohibited to do it.</li>

                <li>Remember the time when your earthly parents were feeding you as a baby? Sometimes they fed you using their own hands and you did not need to worry for there would surely be food on your table.</li>
                <li>God also wants to feed you using His hands. However, as we grow older, we try to put things into our own hands. Now, as we move out from God's feeding zone, it is uncertain if we have food in our "own" table.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a father, God gives the best. Look at the flowers of the field. Are they not beautiful? Who do you think clothes them? God gives the best for them. The Bible says, "Not even Solomon (the richest man) was clothed this way." (Matthew 6:28-29)</p>
            <p>Will worry improve your LIFE today? Instead of worrying, start worshiping God.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>God is the Creator of heaven and earth. And He is our Father who can provide everything we need.</li>
                <li>Worry destroys your life by giving you so much stress.</li>
                <li>Start worshiping God today that you may enjoy LIFE and your thirst may be quenched.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Surrender means to entrust everything to God, including all your worries in life. This is an act of worship to our God and worship quenches your thirst.</p>
