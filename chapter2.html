            <p class="quote">Proverbs 10:9 NASB</p>
            <p>He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>Integrity is the prerequisite for lasting change. Integrity is the quality of being complete and having undivided moral soundness, where your life and your words are telling the same story. Wouldn't it feel so good and fulfilling not to have to go on hiding and lying forever?</p>
            <p>What's underneath the iceberg?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>BEHAVIOR</li>
                <li>SPEECH</li>
                <li>THOUGHTS & ATTITUDE</li>
                <li>BELIEFS & VALUES</li>
                <li>INTEGRITY</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We sometimes desire to change for superficial reasons, like to be slim or to be accepted by others. That is just the tip of the iceberg. But when integrity is our foundation for change, we change to be like Jesus and experience true freedom from the inside out. Core values, attitudes, and behavior are all shaped through our integrity.</p>
            <p>There are powerful transforming effects of building our integrity:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We develop meaningful relationships.</li>
                <li>We experience peace, attainable only when we allow Jesus to help us in the process of being a winner and overcomer. We can move freely and with good conscience.</li>
                <li>We bring greater impact to others and truly shine for God.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

                <li>How can we describe a person of integrity?</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <p>With Jesus, there is freedom, hope, and power to change! You may think you're trapped in your bad habits and bondages, but when we surrender our will to God, He can help us change and experience a progressive life. Don't do it alone; you have the Lord to help you along the way.</p>
            <p>Lasting change comes from the inside out, when we value integrity. To be real with yourself, God, and others is a daily step to experience peace, victory, and freedom.</p>
            <p>How can you begin walking in victory this week?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Lord, thank You for giving me a second chance in life. I want to know You more so I can walk again with an honest heart. Help me develop my integrity so I can experience Your peace and stop pretending and hiding. Let me have meaningful relationships that bring me closer to You. Let me continuously change for You and be a blessing to others. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.</p>

        <h2>Lesson 2: Forgiveness: The Best Choice</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>CONNECT</h3>
            <p>There was a story about two friends who were walking through the desert. At some point, they had an argument and one friend slapped the other in the face. The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand: "Today my best friend slapped me in the face." They kept walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but his friend saved him. After he recovered, he wrote on a stone: "Today my best friend saved my life." The friend asked: "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone. Why?" The other friend replied: "When someone hurts you, we should write it down in sand so the winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good, we must engrave it on a stone where no wind can ever erase it." - (author unknown)</p>
            <p>Have you ever kept a grudge for years? How does it feel? Has the past gotten a hold on you now that you have a hard time moving on?</p>

            <p class="quote">Ephesians 4:32 KJV</p>
            <p>And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>If God can forgive us of our worst sins, why can't we show mercy and forgive others?</p>
            <p>To be a winner in Christ, one must have a forgiving attitude. Why? Because we live amidst imperfect people and we ourselves are imperfect. Jesus said we should forgive seventy times seven, symbolizing "forever." Without forgiveness, no relationship will stand strong. With unforgiveness, you stay suspicious of others’ intentions, making you a prisoner of the past.</p>
            <p>Unforgiveness is taking matters into your own hands. Forgiveness is taking matters into God's hands, believing He will bless and restore what was lost.</p>

                <li>What is the effect of being angry and bitter with somebody? Does it affect sleep, body, mind, or future?</li>
                <li>Have you tried forgiving somebody? Was it fulfilling?</li>
                <li>Do you have someone in mind you need to say sorry to? Or someone asking for your forgiveness?</li>

            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <p>Mark 11:25 NIV: "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive your sins."</p>
            <p>Salvation is about God's forgiveness for us. To know we are truly forgiven, we should learn to forgive those who hurt us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Lord, forgive me for my unforgiving heart. I'm willing to let go and forgive my enemies and those who hurt me. Please forgive me for the hurts I caused others as well. I forgive (state name) for hurting me. I want to be free from pain, anger, and hatred so I can love again and trust people around me. Amen.</p>

                <li>A horse will weigh about 1,000 pounds but when controlled by a bit, attached to a bridle that weighs a few ounces, the horse can be guided to go left or right, or even stop this large animal from moving. This bit lies on top of its tongue, so that it can control the horse to obey the rider. By controlling its mouth, the head is controlled and in effect, the whole body is controlled to a certain direction. The same goes with our tongue!</li>

            <h3>CONNECT</h3>
            <p>Have you ever tried fishing? Were you able to catch a fish? A lot of patience is needed, right? But Satan is more patient and smarter to put something on a hook to catch your attention and keep you away from God and a fulfilling life. So, what attracts you?</p>
            <p>Is there anything dangling in front of you every day? Like lust, money, career, or fame? The devil tempts you at your weak point. Remember, in every temptation, there is a hook.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>WORDS TO PONDER</h3>
            <p class="quote">1 Corinthians 10:12-13 NIV</p>
            <p>12 So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To tempt means "to lure". From the Greek word "deleazo", meaning "bait". To hook or set a trap with a bait, to entice victims into a moral trap, tempting them through their own selfish desires. Satan can dangle something that looks good in front of our very face, but this contains hidden danger like the bait on a hook. The bait can be very attractive, but wait until you're bitten by the hook that hides within it! It gives you quick satisfaction but a long-term regret!</li>
                <li>All temptations can be beaten! Everyone has to deal with temptation at one time or another, so you don't have to feel embarrassed. However, you don't have to give in to it like the fish because it is something you can overcome! You just need to make up your mind that you're going to be the conqueror and not the conquered!</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <p>Temptation is not yet a sin, but can give birth to sin, leading to death. Sin is missing the mark, just like when you aim your arrow to hit bullseye on the will of God. But somehow, you missed the mark because you were aiming your arrow on another target that satisfies your flesh (like lust, money, smoking, career, etc.)</p>
            <p>Why Death? An egg that is conceived in sin destroys the baby, and eventually gives you a stillborn child. You think sin will make you rich, feel loved, and complete, despite losing your integrity. In the end, it only leaves you an empty wallet and hurting relationships, leaving you defeated, incomplete, and without peace.</p>
            <p>But JESUS is your answer! He promised that He is faithful to make you win the battle if you let Him. He won't give up on you. He'll even find a way of escape and make you rejoice in victory!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Flee from temptation on its first onset.</li>
                <li>Fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith. Stay in the word; stay in His will.</li>
                <li>Finish the day, worshiping and acknowledging God. Run away from sin, and run towards Jesus at all times and at all cost!</li>

            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Lord, I may fail along the way. I am not as strong as I should be. But with Your help, Holy Spirit, I'll win this battle. You taught me to never do it alone or I'll never pass the test. From now on, I'll wake up to worship You, decide to walk with You each day, and win LIFE for Your name. For You are my reward and my portion. I'm claiming a great, blessed life with You! In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Worship is like climbing a mountain. You go up giving honor to God with your sacrifices, thanksgiving, and requests. We don't realize that when we climb up rejoicing and putting our trust in Him, He provides His "ram" at the other side of the mountain (Genesis 22:13-14).</li>
                <li>You become more than a conqueror when you go down the valley because now, you believe God is fighting your battles, giving you the victory in LIFE!</li>
                <li>In His presence, there is healing, strength, and power to persevere and live a successful, prosperous and GREATER LIFE!</li>
                <li>So ENJOY your C2S day! This day is a good time to share your testimonies the past weeks, how you've learned to win in LIFE. Better yet, bond with your group over a cup of coffee @iCafé!</li>

            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Lord, You are my strength, my personal bravery and my invincible army. I will bless Your name at all times. I will climb Your mountain everyday and go down with Your presence and power, knowing that I'll be better for You each day! I'll be Your winner. I'll be Your faithful son/daughter. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>

            <h3>CONNECT</h3>
            <p>Have you ever experienced riding in a jeepney and seated next to the driver, tasked to receive the fare of other passengers, turn it over to the driver and give back the change to the passenger? How did it feel? Were you waiting for some words to be said while doing the said task? Will you still sit next to the driver the next time?</p>

            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning to be grateful is a trait that is essential to winning in life. The concept of being grateful originated from the use of two Greek words: "charizomai" coming from "charis", which means grace, and "homolegeo", which means to confess or acknowledge. All that we possess is a fruit of God's grace, and therefore, we acknowledge that everything is made possible, through, by and for Him.</li>
                <li>A grateful heart is aligned to the heartbeat of God. It is a form of worship that pleases Him, and in doing so, we fulfill our purpose before Him and before men.</li>
                <li>Blessings are right in front of you! Most of the time, we look for big miracles to happen and fail to recognize that blessings are already poured out on us. The moment you open your eyes each day and close them to sleep is a beautiful miracle that you should be thankful for. So count your blessings one by one and thank God and the people whom He used to be a channel for you to achieve a certain victory.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>DIG DEEP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When was the last time you uttered the words "thank you"?</li>
                <li>Is it a habit of yours to say thank you for favors done to you?</li>
                <li>Have you ever done a favor that was not acknowledged? How did it feel?</li>
                <li>Will you still say "thank you" even if you did not get the favor that you asked for?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Trust in the Lord always. Trusting the Lord is a manifestation of being grateful. It is an act of faith that pleases the Lord and a way of saying that we are limited but the God who has created us is so powerful.</li>
                <li>Handle each victory in humility. You are a certified winner if in every hurdle that you pass through, you keep your feet on the ground.</li>
                <li>Act with loving kindness. A grateful heart is coupled with a mindset that one is blessed to be a blessing.</li>
                <li>Nourish the gift that is entrusted to you. Winners would never settle for anything less than the best.</li>
                <li>Keep on pressing until you've finished the race that is set before you. A grateful winner does not quit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>PRAYER</h3>
            <p>Lord, I know that I have a lot of things to thank You for. That the words "thank You" would not be enough to express how grateful I am for all the grace and love that You have unselfishly bestowed upon me. As my way of thanking You, teach me to be grateful even in the smallest blessings and miracles in life, in the trials and testing that I may face. May I be of help to others who are in need and manifest Your love to them. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
