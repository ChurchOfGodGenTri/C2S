        <h2>Lesson 1: The "I" That Matters Most</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>CONNECT</h3>
            <p>Give your comment on the following situation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An unsynchronized orchestra.</li>
                <li>A preacher who does not practice what he preach.</li>

            </ul>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>WORDS TO PONDER</h3>
            <p class="quote">Proverbs 10:9 NASB</p>
            <p>He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>Integrity is the prerequisite for lasting change. Integrity is the quality of being complete and having undivided moral soundness, where your life and your words are telling the same story. Wouldn't it feel so good and fulfilling not to have to go on hiding and lying forever?</p>
            <p>What's underneath the iceberg?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>BEHAVIOR</li>
                <li>SPEECH</li>
                <li>THOUGHTS & ATTITUDE</li>
                <li>BELIEFS & VALUES</li>
                <li>INTEGRITY</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We sometimes desire to change for superficial reasons, like to be slim or to be accepted by others. That is just the tip of the iceberg. But when integrity is our foundation for change, we change to be like Jesus and experience true freedom from the inside out. Core values, attitudes, and behavior are all shaped through our integrity.</p>
            <p>There are powerful transforming effects of building our integrity:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We develop meaningful relationships.</li>
                <li>We experience peace, attainable only when we allow Jesus to help us in the process of being a winner and overcomer. We can move freely and with good conscience.</li>
                <li>We bring greater impact to others and truly shine for God.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>DIG DEEP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How can we describe a person of integrity?</li>
                <li>What steps are needed to develop integrity?</li>
                <li>What is missing in the process that prevents change in our lives?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <p>With Jesus, there is freedom, hope, and power to change! You may think you're trapped in your bad habits and bondages, but when we surrender our will to God, He can help us change and experience a progressive life. Don't do it alone; you have the Lord to help you along the way.</p>
            <p>Lasting change comes from the inside out, when we value integrity. To be real with yourself, God, and others is a daily step to experience peace, victory, and freedom.</p>
            <p>How can you begin walking in victory this week?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Lord, thank You for giving me a second chance in life. I want to know You more so I can walk again with an honest heart. Help me develop my integrity so I can experience Your peace and stop pretending and hiding. Let me have meaningful relationships that bring me closer to You. Let me continuously change for You and be a blessing to others. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.</p>

    <section id="lesson2">
        <h2>Lesson 2: Forgiveness: The Best Choice</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>CONNECT</h3>
            <p>There was a story about two friends who were walking through the desert. At some point, they had an argument and one friend slapped the other in the face. The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand: "Today my best friend slapped me in the face." They kept walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but his friend saved him. After he recovered, he wrote on a stone: "Today my best friend saved my life." The friend asked: "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone. Why?" The other friend replied: "When someone hurts you, we should write it down in sand so the winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good, we must engrave it on a stone where no wind can ever erase it." - (author unknown)</p>
            <p>Have you ever kept a grudge for years? How does it feel? Has the past gotten a hold on you now that you have a hard time moving on?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>WORDS TO PONDER</h3>
            <p class="quote">Ephesians 4:32 KJV</p>
            <p>And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>POINTERS</h3>
            <p>If God can forgive us of our worst sins, why can't we show mercy and forgive others?</p>
            <p>To be a winner in Christ, one must have a forgiving attitude. Why? Because we live amidst imperfect people and we ourselves are imperfect. Jesus said we should forgive seventy times seven, symbolizing "forever." Without forgiveness, no relationship will stand strong. With unforgiveness, you stay suspicious of others’ intentions, making you a prisoner of the past.</p>
            <p>Unforgiveness is taking matters into your own hands. Forgiveness is taking matters into God's hands, believing He will bless and restore what was lost.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>DIG DEEP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you willing to forgive a person who hurt you but never said "I'm sorry"? Yes or no? Why?</li>
                <li>What is the effect of being angry and bitter with somebody? Does it affect sleep, body, mind, or future?</li>
                <li>Have you tried forgiving somebody? Was it fulfilling?</li>
                <li>Do you have someone in mind you need to say sorry to? Or someone asking for your forgiveness?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>LIFE APPLICATION</h3>
            <p>Mark 11:25 NIV: "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive your sins."</p>
            <p>Salvation is about God's forgiveness for us. To know we are truly forgiven, we should learn to forgive those who hurt us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>PRAY</h3>
            <p>Lord, forgive me for my unforgiving heart. I'm willing to let go and forgive my enemies and those who hurt me. Please forgive me for the hurts I caused others as well. I forgive (state name) for hurting me. I want to be free from pain, anger, and hatred so I can love again and trust people around me. Amen.</p>
